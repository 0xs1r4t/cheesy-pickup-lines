A bot that uses cheesy pick-up lines to flirt with you <3

## Why are there just folders with versions here?

1. **Version 1**

    - Created during a [hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/cheesy-pick-up-line-generator).
    - Was created in under 24 hours.


2. **Version 2**

    - Was a hackathon afterthought
    - You can play around with the Jupyter Notebook but there's nothing special about it


3. **Version 3**

    - Still under development
    - Will be a smooth twitter bot soon!

Tip - Switch to the main branch to main to view the original form of the bot.
